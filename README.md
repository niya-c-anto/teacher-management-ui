## 🎥 STEP 2: Loom Video Script (Talk Like This)

> “Hi, I’m Niya and this is a walkthrough of my modern Teacher Management UI built for the frontend assessment.  
I used **Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS** to build a responsive, clean, and accessible interface.  
This page shows a teacher profile with contact info, qualifications, and a weekly schedule with time-blocked lessons.  
I followed a mobile-first design with soft gradients, hover transitions, and custom cards.  
The project is fully deployed on Vercel and available on GitHub.  
Thanks for watching!”

⏱️ Keep it under **2–5 minutes**  
✅ Show the UI  
✅ Click through cards/schedule  
✅ Highlight responsiveness by shrinking the window  
✅ Mention tech stack + GitHub + Vercel
